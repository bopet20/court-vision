# Court Vision

[Court Vision](https://courtvision.netlify.com) is a web app for assessing fantasy basketball schedules.
Never have players with games on your bench again.
This app uses the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io) for its data.

## Background
In [fantasy basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_basketball), players act as team general managers (GMs) and draft real-life NBA players into their own fantasy team. These NBA players' stats in real life reflect how they perform on the fantasy team. There are limited slots in a fantasy team's starting roster, so GMs must take into account how many real-life games are being played in a given day and how many of their players can fit in certain starter positions.

## Features

* Alerts you when you have players with games forced to sit on your bench
* Automatically sorts your players with games into the correct starter slots
* View weekly schedules, including when it matters most -- playoffs
* Test out lineups with easy player adds and drops
